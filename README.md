intelligence-analyzer
=================

Analyzes your intelligence... or not! A skeleton project for analyzing results from the NPR debate series Intelligence Squared US. Results in JSON format provided by the [intelligence-json repository][1]. 

Clone/fork and remember to git submodule init/update because the JSON being analyzed is from an external respository. Enjoy!
